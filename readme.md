Which I need plenty of. But there might be a viable product here, when it's all said and done!

My purpose is to build a simple blog. The user can login, edit entries, or create new entries.

The entries display on a blog page which is tied ot the user's name.

MySQL manages the data, JSPs manage the display, and Java is the controller.

There's probably a lot more here that I'm not thinking of right now, but that's a good start, no?
